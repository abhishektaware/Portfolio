                    <p>
                        A Fixed Price, Outcome-based engagement with HSBC CMB, redesigning the user experience for the business banking platform (called Digital Business Banking or “DBB”). 

                        This was an important engagement for the bank -- their user interface was on old tech (Angular JS) which didn’t lend itself well to agile iteration of online banking user experiences and cost a lot to maintain. The bank asked for IBM’s help in migrating the UI from Angular JS to a more modern framework called React, which has more intuitive coding standards and enhanced reusable component library. It also required less CPU and memory usage.
